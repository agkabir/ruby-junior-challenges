## Background & Objectives

Now it's time to make a 3-model app! And you guessed it, we'll be introducing a many to many relationship (`N:N`). So what's the deal? Well, itâ€™s time to build yourself a Watch List. You'll be able to create lists in which you will save your favourite movies.

## Rails app generation

```bash
cd ~
rails new movie-watch-list -j webpack -d postgresql --skip-action-mailbox -T
cd movie-watch-list
```

We then need to create the postgresql database for this new rails app.

```bash
rails db:create
```

Let's set up git, create a repo on GitHub and push our skeleton.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "rails new"
gh repo create --public --source=.
git push origin master
```

## Specs

### 1 - Models

#### Attributes

- A **movie**has a **title** (e.g.`"Wonder Woman 1984"`), an **overview** (`"Wonder Woman comes into conflict with the Soviet Union during the Cold War in the 1980s!"`), a **poster url** and a **rating** (6.9).
- A **list**has a **name** (e.g.`"Drama"`,`"Comedy"`, `"Classic"`, `"To rewatch"`, ... )
- A **bookmark** adds a movie to a list (e.g. Wonder Woman has been added to the "Girl Power" watch list). So each **bookmark** references a movie and a list, with a **comment**. The **comment** field is for the user to add a little note on the bookmark (e.g. Alan Turing recommended this movie).

#### Validation

- A movie must have a unique title and an overview.
- A list must have a unique name.
- A bookmark must be linked to a movie and a list, and the [movie, list] pairings should be unique.
- The comment of a bookmark cannot be shorter than 6 characters.

#### Associations

- A list has many bookmarks
- A list has many movies through bookmarks
- A list belongs to a user
- A movie has many bookmarks
- A bookmark belongs to a movie
- A bookmark belongs to a list
- You canâ€™t delete a movie if it is referenced in at least one bookmark.
- When you delete a list, you should delete all associated bookmarks (but not the movies as they can be referenced in other lists).

### 2 - Seed the movies

**Our app will not allow users to create movies**.
Instead, we will generate a static seed of movies to choose from.
Write this seed, for example

```ruby
# db/seeds.rb
Movie.create(title: "Wonder Woman 1984", overview: "Wonder Woman comes into conflict with the Soviet Union during the Cold War in the 1980s", poster_url: "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/8UlWHLMpgZm9bx6QYh0NFoq67TZ.jpg", rating: 6.9)
Movie.create(title: "The Shawshank Redemption", overview: "Framed in the 1940s for double murder, upstanding banker Andy Dufresne begins a new life at the Shawshank prison", poster_url: "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/q6y0Go1tsGEsmtFryDOJo3dEmqu.jpg", rating: 8.7)
Movie.create(title: "Titanic", overview: "101-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater tells the story of her life aboard the Titanic.", poster_url: "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/9xjZS2rlVxm8SFx8kPC3aIGCOYQ.jpg", rating: 7.9)
Movie.create(title: "Ocean's Eight", overview: "Debbie Ocean, a criminal mastermind, gathers a crew of female thieves to pull off the heist of the century.", poster_url: "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/MvYpKlpFukTivnlBhizGbkAe3v.jpg", rating: 7.0)
```

### Optional:

Have fun and seed fake movies using the [faker gem](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker).

Even better, seed real movies by using [this API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-top-rated-movies) (with `open-uri` and `json` ruby libs).

**API Setup**

The endpoints of the API requires you to sign up and generate an API key.

**Movie Images**

To understand how to get the movie images from the API, make sure to carefully read [this page](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/images) in the docs.

### 3 - Routing, Controller, Views for Lists

**Important**

Don't use `rake` to code the applicative part. It's time to launch a `rails s` in your terminal and open a browser at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Always code in silo:

- start with the **route**,
- then start coding the **controller**,
- finally start coding the **view** and refresh your browser.

When your feature is done (and looks good), move on to the next one and repeat the process!

When you think you're done with the **whole** challenge, use `rake` to make sure it satisfies the specs.

**Features**
Once again, you must have a precise idea of the features of your app in order to build your routes. Here is the list of features:

- A user can see all the lists on the app

```
GET "lists"
```

- A user can see the details of a given list and its name

```
GET "lists/42"
```

- A user can create a new list for themselves

```
GET "lists/new"
POST "lists"
```

### 4 - Routing, Controller, Views for bookmarks

- A user can add a new bookmark (movie/list pair) to an existing list he owns
- Checkout`simple_form`[docs](https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form#associations)about`f.association`to easily create a select dropdown for our list of movies.

```
GET "lists/42/bookmarks/new"
POST "lists/42/bookmarks"
```

- A user can delete a bookmark from a list. How can we make a delete link again?

```
DELETE "bookmarks/25"
```

Do we need a `MoviesController`?

### 5 - Design as we go

Now time to make a nice front-end! Time to play around with CSS! ðŸ˜Š Go check out [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) or [onepagelove](https://onepagelove.com/) for inspiration.

Don't forget you can have local images in the `app/assets/images` folder. Or even better, you can ask the user for an `image_url` when the user adds a new list.

### 6 - New bookmark form on the list show page (Optional)

Try to put the "New bookmark form" on the list page itself, not on a separate page, so you won't have to leave the list page to add a new movie! What changes in the routes? And in the controllers?

### 7 - List reviews (Optional)

Everyone should be able to comment and tell us what they thought of our movie collection. Let's add some reviews to our lists!

### 8 - Going further

- Adding a possibility to search for movies.
- Check out [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) if you want to add some JS in a nice way
