The file order to complete this lesson:

1. Familarize yourself with the four lib/ files.
   - lib/caesar_main
   - lib/caesar_breaker
   - lib/caesar_translator which is based on the typical Caesar Cipher
   - lib/database (module)
2. Check out the completed tests in spec/caesar_translator.
3. Complete spec/caesar_breaker_spec.

The CaesarBreaker class creates the 26 possible translations (using the
CaesarTranslator class) & saves them in a yaml file (using a Database module).

# Demo
`ruby lib/caesar_man.rb`
