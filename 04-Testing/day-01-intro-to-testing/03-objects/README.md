## Background & Objectives

In the previous exercise, we were testing functions. Let's turn it up a notch and test some objects!

## Setup

In this exercise, we'll be finishing the specs for some classes. There are already partial specs written; your job is to look at how they are done, and complete the spec.

## Person
The first class is `Person`. The constructor takes a first and last name, and an age. You will need to finish the spec
by testing the #full_name, #initials, and #can_buy_beer? methods.

Additionally, it looks like whoever wrote this class doesn't like beer - fix that mistake by changing the #can_buy_beer?
method to check that the provided age is at least 16, then test it.


## Go Further

Once all your tests are green, add some more tests (or extend the class with more methods, and test those!)

## Key Learning Points

- Learn to read a class and think of a an appropriate test suite for it
- Think about what is and isn't important to test. You shouldn't need to test the #initialize method (there shouldn't be
  any behavior in it), but the rest of the public API is fair game.
