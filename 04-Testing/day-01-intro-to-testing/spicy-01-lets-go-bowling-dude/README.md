## Background & Objectives

Let's implement a bowling score calculator. You can choose to solve this assignment using a method or a class.

Either the way, the data type of your input should be an array of integers, looking something like this

```ruby
  lebowski_rolls = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10] 
  # or this
  nick_rolls = [1, 2, 10, 10, 2, 0, 7, 3, 7, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 9, 0, 4, 0]
```
