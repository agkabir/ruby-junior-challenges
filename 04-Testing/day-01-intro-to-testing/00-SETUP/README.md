## Gems

Since we'll be using some new tools, lets make sure everything is installed:

`gem install rspec rspec-expectations rspec-mocks rspec-support`

## Background & Objectives

Over the next few days, we're going to be taking an in-depth look at Testing. These assignments might seem strange at
first, since up until now you've been relying on pre-written tests, but the importance of testing cannot be overstated.

The tool we're using, RSpec, is the exact same tool we use at Karnov to handle testing, and is in fact one of the most
commonly used testing tools in the greater Ruby world! That means you're going to be using it a lot in your career :)

The goal with this module is to get comfortable with the different aspects of testing, how to think about testing, what
to test, etc. You'll find much of the usual README content is in the spec file instead of the normal place, so be sure
to read that as you go.
