This should be a pretty quick exercise - take the specs and classes from the previous exercise,
and split them into mutiple files. It should look like:

lib/class.rb
spec/class_spec.rb

Running rake should run the spec files, which should correctly load the classes, and pass all specs.

The goal here is to get comfortable flipping between multiple files - the spec and the class
