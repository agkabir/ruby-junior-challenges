## Background and Objectives

```bash
  cd ~/karnov-ruby-challenges/02-shaken-not-stirred
  rake
  code .
```

People are noticing your rapidly growing programmer skills. You've been hired by MI6 to build their top secret software that spies use to introduce themselves when they email.

- Get acquainted with Command Line Interfaces(CLI) in Ruby
- See how two files can work together
- Learn which parts of the code are reuseable from one file to the other.

## Specs

### Introduce Spy

- Implement the `#introduce_spy` method defined in the `lib/shaken_not_stirred.rb` file. It should return a string in this format: `The name's BOND, James BOND`.

### Interface

It's very rare you'll ever have to write code from scratch in your career. The ability to read code efficiently is just as important as the ability to write it properly. Take some time to read the code in `lib/interface.rb` and understand what's going on.

The interface is almost all for you already. There's only one line you need to modify, but you'll have to find which one and how you need to modify it.


## Learning Badges

Ask yourself these questions and make sure you can answer all of them:


### on string manipulation
* Which two ways do you know to glue multiple strings together? (learn the terminology too)
* Which of these do you prefer and why?

### on interface vs logic
* Notice how this code is separated across two files.
* What is the advantage of separating this code in two files?
* Which line in the code allows the two files to work together?
* Which parts of the code are shared and which are not?
