## Background and Objectives

```bash
  cd ~/karnov-ruby-challenges/sweet-01-geller-special
  rake
  code .
```

The Geller Special is named after [Monica Geller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Geller), a character from the show FRIENDS famous for being super clean and meticulous.

In this assignment, the code is already written but it is full of syntax errors. The four errors present in this assignment are the most common ones for beginners, so it's helpful to be aware of what they are and how to fix them.

You have to read the code, identify the errors and correct them. Reading code is an absolute key skill for developers, and the more you train it the better.

- Train your code reading skills and find syntax errors
- Try not to rake immediately and see if you can find the errors on your own first
- Figure out which parts of the syntax are challenging for you and be mindful of them

## Specs

### add_two_numbers

- This method adds two numbers, but it's not working right now. Can you figure out why?

### cryptostring

- This method is quite stupid and just shuffles the characters around in a string. But there's a problem with it, and you need to figure out what it is.

### can_you_vote?

- This simple method returns true if the age is over 18, and false if it's not. But why is it not running?

### bio

- This method computes a string presenting someone based on their age, name and location. The code may seem fine at first glance but there's a little problem with it.

## Key Takeaways

Again, ask yourself these questions:

### Syntax

* Which of the errors popped out as the most obvious one?
* Which errors were hard for you to figure out?
* Be mindful of the errors that were difficult for you to spot. Those will most likely be the area(s) where you will tend to make syntax mistakes.
