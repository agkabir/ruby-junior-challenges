## Background & Objectives

Learn how to sum numbers using the each method

## Specs

- Write a method in ruby that computes the sum of the integers between a min value and a max value (min and max included).
- If the min value is greater than the max value, it should return `-1`
- You can't use methods like map, sum or reduce. We don't want to make this too easy

## Further suggestions & resources

- [ruby loops](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_loops.htm)
- In Ruby, using an `each` iterator is considered more idiomatic than a `for` loop when you want to iterate through a collection.
